# planet_cubicus_species
An artificially generated dataset of species with various attributes depending on the climate zone. Goal: Provide a data set for data mining. The model is very simple. It's meaningfulness in the biological sense is rather limited, but the data set provides an excellent playground for data analysis. 

## Abstract
This population generator is a small piece of python software which aims to generate a big set of population data. It generates a flat file comprising records of species that live on the imaginary model planet Cubicus. The species have some model attributes like length and furr colour. They depend on the country they live in. Their abundance per country depends on the local climate. 

To keep things simple, the features of the model are as trivial as possible, yet, meaningful enough to experiment with proceeding and analysing big data. Thus, Planet Cubicus is a model planet where continents and countries are cubic and climate zones depend on the longitude only. However, it is by far not good enough to simulate a proper exoplanet or reproduce realistic features of populations, biological or evolutionary laws. As mentioned, the only aim is to deliver a big data set for data analysis.

## Planet Cubicus Map

Have a look at the model map. Planet Cubicus consists of 14 countries distributed over three continents. The continents are separated by oceans. The climate zones in the far north and the far south are the coldest, getting ever warmer along the longitude towards theequator. So some features are much like that of the earth, however, much simpler. For example, there are no alpine regions.
